For an explanation of what each of the properties in the examples, below mean, 
see <Link href="/?path=/docs/f-json-component">Component JSON</Link>.

## Equality

```json
{
  "id":        "staffGradeId",
  /* ... */
  "show_when": {
    "field": "areYouACivilServant",
    "op": "eq",
    "value": "yes"
  }
}
```

In the above example, the `staffGradeId` component will **only** be shown when the value
of `areYouACivilServant` is equal to `"yes"`.

Note that in this example, `areYouACivilServant` is also of type `radios` and that `"yes"`
refers to the underlying value, not what is displayed in the user interface (the sentence case `"Yes"`).

### When to use an equality operator
Use the equality operators (`=`, `eq`) if you want something to show only under specific
circumstances and be hidden by default. This is *typically* the appropriate behaviour but,
should you want the opposite - i.e., **show** by default **show** - you should use
the Inequality operators, below.

## Inequality

```json
{
  "id":        "staffGradeId",
  /* ... */
  "show_when": {
    "field": "areYouACivilServant",
    "op": "neq",
    "value": "no-contractor"
  }
}
```

In the above example, the `staffGradeId` component will **only** be shown when the value
of `areYouACivilServant` is **not** equal to `"no-contractor"`, which means it will be
shown if the value is `"yes"`, `"no-agency"`, or even `null`, `undefined`, or `""`, all of
which are not equal to `"no-contractor"`.

### When to use an inequality operator
Use the inequality operators (`!=`, `<>`, `ne`, and `neq`) if you want something to show by
default but be hidden under specific circumstances. You will *typically* want the opposite
behaviour - i.e., to only **show** under specific circumstances - for which you should use
the Equality operators, above.


## Within array (any one of)

```json
{
  "id": "delegateEmails",
  /* ... */
  "show_when": {
    "field": "staffGradeId",
    "op": "in",
    "values": [ "senior-a", "senior-b", "senior-c" ]
  }
}
```

In the above example, the `delegateEmails` component will **only** be shown when the value
of `staffGradeId` is **one of** 5 different values, specified within the `"values"` array.
If `staffGradeId` is not one of those values, `delegateEmails` will be hidden.

In this scenario, those items in the `"values"` array are (fake) IDs for **senior** grades,
which means there will be no option to specify a delegate email for non-senior officers. This
means that if a new grade is introduced, the `delegateEmails` component will **not** show for
it without making any changes to the above configuration.

### When to use an `in` operator
Use the `in` operator when you want a component to **show** if another component is set to one
of a defined number of known values.


## Not within array (not one of)

```json
{
  "id": "delegateEmails",
  /* ... */
  "show_when": {
    "field": "staffGradeId",
    "op": "nin",
    "values": [ "junior-a", "junior-b", "junior-c" ]
  }
}
```

In the above example, the `delegateEmails` component will **not** be shown when the value
of `staffGradeId` is **one of** 5 different values, specified within the `"values"` array.
If `staffGradeId` is **not** one of those values, `delegateEmails` will be shown.

In this scenario, those items in the `"values"` array are (fake) IDs for **non-senior** grades,
which means, slightly different to the previous example, the option to set a delegate email will
only be hidden from non-senior officers. This means that if a new grade is introduced, the
`delegateEmails` component **will** show for it without making any changes to the above
configuration.

### When to use a `nin` operator
Use the `nin` operator when you want a component to **hide** if another component is set to one
of a defined number of known values.

Most scenarios would call for the the `in` operator, rather than the `nin` one, but this is a
useful option if there are a large number of items for which you would want it to show but a
much smaller and more manageable number for which you would want it hidden.

## At least one condition met

```json
{
  "id": "delegateEmails",
  /* ... */
  "show_when": {
    "type" : "or",
    "conditions": [
      {
        "field": "areYouACivilServant",
        "op": "=",
        "value": "yes"    
      },
      {
        "field": "staffGradeId",
        "op": "=",
        "value": "junior-a"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
In the above example, the `delegateEmails` component **will** be shown when the value of **at least one of** 
the following two conditions are true. `areYouACivilServant` equals "yes" **or** `staffGradeId` equals 
"junior-a". If **none** of the provided condtions are true `delegateEmails` will **not** be shown.

In this scenario, the value "junior-a" for `staffGradeId` is not valid and will evaluate to false. However, 
if the value of `areYouACivilServant` is "yes", `delegateEmails` will still be shown.

### When to use type `or`

Use type `or` when you want a component, page or container to be shown if **at least one** of the conditions you provide are true.

## Contains

```json
{
  "id": "BMWModel",
  /* ... */
  "show_when": {
    "field": "cars",
    "op": "contains",
    "values": "BMW"
  }
}
```

In the above example, the `BMWModel` component **will** be shown when the value
of the `cars` field **contains** `BMW`.

In this scenario, the component will be shown if the `cars` field is one of the following: <br/>
An array containing `BMW` e.g. `"cars": "['Ford', 'Mercedes', 'BMW', 'Lexus']"` <br/>
A string containing `BMW` e.g. `"cars": "Ford,Mercedes,BMW,LEXUS"` <br/>
Note: `contains` also works for integer arrays

### When to use a `contains` operator
Use the `contains` operator when you want to show a component on the condition that a field contains a given value.
