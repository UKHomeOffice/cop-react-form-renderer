The form types available in the JSON for rendering a <Link href="/?path=/docs/d-formrenderer">Form</Link>.

## `cya`
<Tag>Yet to do</Tag>

A form made up of a series of <Link href="/?path=/docs/f-json-page">pages</Link>,
which then has a **Check your answers** screen at the end, prior to a final submission.
From the **Check your answers** screen, there is the ability to navigate back to any of
the pages via a **Change** link, allowing editing allowing editing of the details on
that <Link href="/?path=/docs/f-json-page">page</Link>.


## `form`
<Tag>Yet to do</Tag>

A simple single-page form. No bells or whistles on this one.


## `hub-and-spoke (default)`

A form that has a starting page (the "hub") that offers navigation to the
other <Link href="/?path=/docs/f-json-page">pages</Link> (the "spokes") that make up the form.
The spokes may contain a single <Link href="/?path=/docs/f-json-page">pages</Link> or a series
of <Link href="/?path=/docs/f-json-page">pages</Link> in a wizard format.

The structure of the hub is identical to the structure of a <Link href="/?path=/docs/f-json-page">page</Link>,
but with the option of simply specifying that the **Check your answers** screen should be used
instead. In such an instance, **Check your answers** is not displayed at the end of the flow as
there *isn't* a flow - the user is returned to the hub at the conclusion of each "spoke".


## `wizard`
<Tag>Yet to do</Tag>

A form made up of a series of <Link href="/?path=/docs/f-json-page">pages</Link>, with **Continue**
(next) and **Back** (previous) navigation options on each <Link href="/?path=/docs/f-json-page">page</Link>.
This is distinct from the `cya` type, above, in that there is no **Check your answers** screen at the end.
