The form types available in the JSON for rendering a <Link href="/?path=/docs/d-formrenderer">Form</Link>.

## `cya`
<Tag>Yet to do</Tag>

A form made up of a series of [pages](#pages), which then has a [**Check your answers**](#checkyouranswers)
screen at the end, prior to a final submission. From the [**Check your answers**](#checkyouranswers) screen,
there is the ability to navigate back to any of the pages via a **Change** link,
allowing editing of the details on that [page](#pages).


## `form`
<Tag>Yet to do</Tag>

A simple single-page form. No bells or whistles on this one.


## `hub-and-spoke (default)`

A form that has a starting page (the "hub") that offers navigation to the other [pages](#pages) (the "spokes")
that make up the form. The spokes may contain a single [page](#pages) or a series
of [pages](#pages) in a [wizard](#wizard) format.

The structure of the [hub](#hub) is identical to the structure of a [page](#pages), but with the
option of simply specifying that the [**Check your answers**](#checkyouranswers) screen should be used instead.
In such an instance, [**Check your answers**](#checkyouranswers) is not displayed at the end of the flow as
there *isn't* a flow - the user is returned to the hub at the conclusion of each "spoke".


## `wizard`
<Tag>Yet to do</Tag>

A form made up of a series of [pages](#pages), with **Continue** (next) and **Back** (previous) navigation
options on each [page](#pages). This is distinct from the [**cya**](#cya) type in that there is no
[**Check your answers**](#checkyouranswers) screen at the end.
