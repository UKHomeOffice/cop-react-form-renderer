# Getting Started with COP React Form Renderer

The COP React Form Renderer is a library that renders a form on the basis of a supplied JSON.

It uses components from [COP React Design System](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/cop-react-design-system).
- `@ukhomeoffice/cop-react-components` - and offers various styles of forms. These are showcased inside of
a [yarn storybook](Storybook) within the project.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn lint`

Runs `eslint` against the project to check for coding issues.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn compile`

Builds the library for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
